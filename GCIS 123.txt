Phase 4

Additional Question Answer
Sorting algorithms can affect the total complexity of the program, as certain search algorithms like binary search arenâ€™t viable, which is a problem for larger datasets as unsorted data leads to inefficient searching. Thus, we need to have an effective sorting algorithm as well to maximize efficiency in searching as well.
Binary search is better than linear search because it divides the array in half through each iteration, meaning that there is less data to sort through, but in linear search it iterates through each element one by one. This results in binary search having a time complexity of O(log n) and linear search having a time complexity of O(n).
Efficient sorting methods enhance performance and, sorting is a pre-cursor to binary search and is required, and makes the whole program faster by reducing the time complexity.
